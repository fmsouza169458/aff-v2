    Calculate CKA for two matrices. This algorithm uses a Gram matrix 
    implementation, which is fast when the data is wider than it is 
    tall.

    This implementation is inspired by the one in this colab:
    https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/google-research/blob/master/representation_similarity/Demo.ipynb#scrollTo=MkucRi3yn7UJ

    Note that we use center the features rather than the Gram matrix
    because we think the latter is tricky and mysterious. It only works for 
    linear CKA though (we only implement linear CKA throughout).

    CKA has several potential implementations. The naive implementation is

    features than examples. In that case, which often happens with DNNs, we 
    prefer the Gram matrix variant.
